## About ##

Omniscience is a very small, simple modification for Minecraft loaded by [LiteLoader](http://liteloader.com) and designed to allow users to see invisible entities and players as partially transparent.

## Features ##

This project contains the following functionality:

- Enable/disable viewing invisible entities as partially transparent.
- Enable/disable viewing invisible players as partially transparent.

## Installation ##

1.  Install proper version of LiteLoader.
2.  Download and move this mode to the proper versioned mods folder. (e.g. `.minecraft/mods/1.8/`)

## Configuration ##

All mod configuration can be accessed via the LiteLoader mods tab in-game.  If you cannot see the tab in the game menu, try pressing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Tab`.
